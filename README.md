scala-samples
=============

Sometimes we need to read some articles, forums, blogs to understand Scala features.
But when we want just remind yourself something we already knew, then is better just look at code sample.

There are samples of scala code that explain how to use some scala features.

This code supposed to be isolated - like if we wish to explain/remember one feature of Scala then we are not
supposing to use 5 more features for that (which we might not understand/remember yet/already).

Each example has no more than 100 lines of code. Also tagging is used in order to show reader what feature is involved
for particular example. Like #feature-1 #feature-3.
