scala-samples
=============

Sometimes we need to read some articles, forums, blogs to understand Scala features.
But when we need just remind yourself something we already knew, then is better just look at code sample.

There are samples of scala code that explain how to use some scala features.

This code supposed to be isolated - like if we wish to explain/remember one feature then we are not
supposing to user 5 more features of languages for that (which we might not understand/remember yet/already).
