scala-samples
=============

Sometimes we need to read some articles, forums, blogs to understand Scala features.
But if we want just remind yourself something we already knew, then is better just look at code sample.
You could easily change it and play with it and see what's going on.

There are samples of Scala code that explain how to use some scala features.

This code supposed to be isolated - like if we wish to explain/remember one feature of Scala then we are not
supposing to use 5 more features for that (which we might not understand/remember yet/already).

Each example has no more than 100 lines of code. Also there is tagging is used in order to show to reader what feature is involved
for particular example. Like #feature-1 #feature-3.
